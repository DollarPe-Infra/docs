Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about various events that occur in your integration. When an event happens, we'll send an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL you've configured.

<Note>
To configure your webhook URL please refer to the [Webhook Configuration](/api-reference/endpoint/organizations/api-webhooks) guide.
</Note>

## Webhook Structure

All webhook notifications follow this consistent structure:

```json
{
  "type": "string",    // The entity type (e.g., "payout", "customer")
  "event": "string",   // The state change event
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific payload
  }
}
```

## Webhook Events

### Payout Events

Payout webhooks are triggered when the status of a payout changes. Below are the possible payout states:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SUCCESS` | The payout has been successfully completed |
| `FAILED` | The payout has failed (e.g., insufficient funds) |
| `REFUNDED` | The payout amount has been reversed |

Example payout webhook payload:
```json
{
  "type": "payout",
  "event": "SUCCESS",
  "timestamp": "2024-03-13T10:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "payout_id": "po_123456789",
    "amount": "1000.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "status": "SUCCESS"
  }
}
```

### Customer Events

Customer webhooks are triggered when a customer's verification status changes. Below are the possible customer states:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PROCESSING` | Customer's KYC verification is under review |
| `VERIFIED` | Customer has completed KYC verification |
| `FAILED` | Customer verification failed or account suspended |

Example customer webhook payload:
```json
{
  "type": "customer",
