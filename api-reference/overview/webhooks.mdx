Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about various events that occur in your integration. When an event happens, we'll send an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL you've configured.

<Note>
To configure your webhook URL please refer to the [Webhook Configuration](/api-reference/endpoint/organizations/api-webhooks) guide.
</Note>

## Webhook Structure

All webhook notifications follow this consistent structure:

```json
{
  "type": "string",           // The entity type (e.g., "PAYOUT", "CUSTOMER")
  "id": "string"              // Unique ID of the entity 
  "event": "string",          // The state change event
  "failure_reason": "string", // In case of FAILED event
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Webhook Events

### Payout Events

Payout webhooks are triggered when the status of a payout changes. Below are the possible payout states:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SUCCESS` | The payout has been successfully completed |
| `FAILED` | The payout has failed (e.g., AML Screening failed) |
| `REFUNDED` | The payout amount has been reversed |

Example payout webhook payload:
```json
{
  "type": "PAYOUT",
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "event": "SUCCESS",
  "failure_reason": null,
  "timestamp": "2024-03-13T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Customer webhooks are triggered when a customer's verification status changes. Below are the possible customer states:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `VERIFIED` | Customer has completed KYC verification |

Example customer webhook payload:
```json
{
  "type": "CUSTOMER",
