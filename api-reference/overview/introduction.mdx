## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using three custom headers:

<ResponseField name="X-API-KEY" type="string" required>
  Your unique API key provided by DollarPe.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-TIMESTAMP" type="integer" required>
  The current Unix timestamp in seconds.

<ResponseField name="X-SIGNATURE" type="string" required>
  An HMAC SHA256 signature of the request, encoded in Base64.
</ResponseField>

For detailed instructions on generating these headers, see our [Authentication Guide](/api-reference/overview/authentication).

## Testing Your Integration

Before going live, thoroughly test your integration in our Sandbox environment:

1. Use Sandbox API credentials and base URLs
2. Test the complete customer journey from registration to payout
3. Verify webhook notifications are properly received and processed
4. Test error scenarios and implement appropriate error handling

For detailed testing instructions, see our [Sandbox Testing Guide](/guides/sandbox-testing).
