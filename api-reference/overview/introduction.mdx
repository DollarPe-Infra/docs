In this section we'll be going over how you can quickly get started with **DollarPe API**, from setting up your authentication to making your first API request.

We'll be building a simple integration that will help you understand the core concepts, and later on we'll show how you can use the DollarPe platform to build more complex payment solutions.

# Installation

To get started with DollarPe API, you'll need to:
1. Get your API credentials (`API Key` and `API Secret`)
2. Choose your environment (`Sandbox` or `Production`)
3. Set up your webhook endpoints

# Prerequisites

- **API Credentials** - You'll need valid API credentials. For access, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@dollarpe.xyz).

- **Development Environment** - Choose the appropriate environment:
  - `Sandbox` - For testing and development
  - `Production` - For live transactions

- **Webhook URL** - A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint to receive transaction updates.

## Base URLs

DollarPe API is available in both Sandbox and Production environments.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Sandbox">
    <ResponseField name="Base URL" type="string">
      `https://sandbox.dollarpe.xyz`
    </ResponseField>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Production">
    <ResponseField name="Base URL" type="string">
      `https://production.dollarpe.xyz`
    </ResponseField>
  </Tab>

<Note>
  Start with the **Sandbox** environment for testing and development. Switch to
  **Production** only when your integration is fully tested and ready for real
  transactions.

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent format:
