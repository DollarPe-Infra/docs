title: 'Mock KYC Status [Sandbox Only]'
openapi: 'PATCH /kyc/mock-kyc-status'
---

<Note>
This endpoint is available only in the **Sandbox environment** and allows you to simulate KYC status changes for testing purposes.

This endpoint follows specific state transition rules:

- If current status is **UNVERIFIED**: No status changes are allowed
- If current status is **FAILED** or **VERIFIED**: Can only be changed to **UNVERIFIED**
- If current status is **PROCESSING**: Can be changed to **TAX_VERIFICATION_FAILED**, **DOCUMENT_VERIFICATION_FAILED**, **VERIFIED**, or **UNVERIFIED**

Attempting to change the status outside of these allowed transitions will result in an error.
