## What Are Payouts and Why They Matter

Payouts enable your application to seamlessly transfer funds to your customers' bank accounts, using cryptocurrency as the funding source. Whether you're a developer or a business owner, this guide will help you integrate DollarPe's Payout system.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** 
  - Ensure you have completed the [authentication setup](/guides/authentication/authentication) 
  - Configure your [webhook endpoint](/guides/webhook) for real-time updates 
  - Review the following guides to ensure compatibility: 
    - **[supported geographies](/guides/support/geographies)** 
    - **[supported stablecoins and blockchains](/guides/support/stablecoins_and_blockchains)** 
    - **[supported fiat methods](/guides/support/fiatMethods)** 
  - Verify your users have completed KYC and have at least one verified bank account
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Warning**: Initiate the payout before the quotation expiry time.
</Warning>

## Integration at a Glance

The Payout integration flow for centralized exchanges involves the following key steps:

1. **Validate user requirements** – Ensure the customer has completed KYC verification and has at least one verified bank account added
2. **Fetch exchange rates** – Retrieve the latest cryptocurrency exchange rates
3. **Create a quotation** – Generate a quote for the desired payout amount
4. **Initiate the payout** – Start the payout using the exchange order ID
5. **Link exchange transfer ID** - Link the exchange transfer ID with the payout
6. **Monitor transaction status** – Track the progress of the transaction
7. **Handle completion** – Finalize the payout once the transaction is confirmed

- `amount`: Amount in cryptocurrency
- `rate`: Current exchange rate (amount of fiat per 1 unit of crypto)

<Tip>
  Rates fluctuate constantly based on market conditions. We recommend fetching a
  new rate before each transaction to ensure accuracy.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Create a Quotation

After getting the current rate, create a quotation to lock in the rate.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  POST /payout/quotation
  {
    "asset": "usdt",
    "fiat": "inr",
    "sending_amount": "51",
    "customer_id": "def8b740-99f9-4cba-bc9e-99de57e927b4",

<Note>You must complete your transaction before this time expires.</Note>

### Step 5: Initiate the Payout

Create a payout request with the exchange order ID:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  POST /payout/initiate
  {
    "quotation_id": "2e104290-07c8-49f1-a5ca-0d27f0078f8a",
    "customer_id": "def8b740-99f9-4cba-bc9e-99de57e927b4",
    "client_reference_id": "testUser123",
    "exchange_order_id": "898990982672892"
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "id": "ac7c5360-0b57-4fb7-88f2-df1c371930ee",

        "customer_id": "8da49e5e-33d1-48b2-b107-eb34f851b2fd",
        "client_reference_id": "payout_first_test",
        "bank_id": "c863b696-7fbd-4b16-b3a7-134aefffb2fe",
        "asset": "USDT",
        "fiat": "INR",
        "rate": 87.2,
        "sending_amount": 10,
        "receiving_amount": 858.96,
        "fees": {
            "client_fee_fiat": "",
            "client_fee_crypto": "",
            "dollarpe_fee": "",
            "pg_fee": "",
            "client_gst_fiat": "",
            "client_gst_crypto": "",
            "dollarpe_gst": "",
            "pg_gst": "",
            "tds": "",
            "gross_exchange_rate": ""
        },
        "exchange_order_id": "898990982672892",
        "created_at": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208137Z",
        "status": "PROCESSING"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Fields:**

- `quotation_id`: ID received from Step 3
- `customer_id`: ID of the KYC-verified customer
- `client_reference_id`: Your internal reference ID for tracking (optional)
- `bank_id`: ID of the verified bank account
- `exchange_order_id`: ID of the order placed at the centralized exchange
- `status`: Current status of the payout

<Note>
  Most payouts are processed within 30-60 minutes, but can take up to 24 hours
  during high volume periods or in case of bank processing delays.
</Note>

### Step 6: Monitor Transaction Status

After linking the exchange transfer ID, you need to track the payout status. There are two ways to monitor this status:

#### Option A: Webhook Integration (Recommended)

Webhooks provide real-time updates about payout status changes. Configure your webhook endpoint to receive these notifications:

```javascript
// Sample webhook payload for payout status updates
{
  "type": "PAYOUT",
  "id": "ac7c5360-0b57-4fb7-88f2-df1c371930ee",
  "event": "COMPLETED", // or "FAILED", "PROCESSING"
  "failure_reason": null, // Contains failure reason if status is "FAILED"
  "timestamp": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208137Z",
  "data": {
    "utr": "123456789012", // Bank reference number (only for COMPLETED status)
    "fiat": "INR",
    "exchange_order_id": "order_123456789"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  If using webhooks, ensure your server acknowledges receipt with a 200 OK
  response to prevent duplicate notifications.
</Tip>

#### Option B: Status Polling

If webhooks aren't feasible, you can periodically check the status using the payout endpoint:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  GET /payout/{payout_id}
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
    {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
      "id": "ac7c5360-0b57-4fb7-88f2-df1c371930ee",
      "quotation_id": "c9f343b5-ff56-4d52-93af-0962f75242b7",
      "customer_id": "8da49e5e-33d1-48b2-b107-eb34f851b2fd",
      "client_reference_id": "payout_first_test",
      "bank_id": "c863b696-7fbd-4b16-b3a7-134aefffb2fe",
      "asset": "USDT",
      "fiat": "INR",
      "sending_amount": "10.00000000",
      "rate": "87.20000000",
      "receiving_amount": "858.96000000",
      "fees": {
        "client_fee": "",
        "dollarpe_fee": "",
        "pg_fee": "",
        "client_gst": "",
        "dollarpe_gst": "",
        "pg_gst": "",
        "tds": "",
        "gross_exchange_rate": ""
      },
      "exchange_order_id": "",
      "exchange_transfer_id": "",
      "status": "PROCESSING",
      "utr": null,
      "failure_reason": "",
      "created_at": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208137Z",
      "updated_at": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208142Z"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  If using the polling approach, we recommend checking no more frequently than
  once every 60 seconds to avoid API rate limits.
</Tip>

**Possible Status Values:**

- `PROCESSING`: Initial state, waiting for crypto confirmation
- `SUCCESS`: Payout has been successfully completed and UTR is generated
- `FAILED`: Payout has failed and failure_reason is updated

### Step 7: Handle Transaction Completion

#### Successful Transactions

When a payout is completed successfully:

1. Update your internal records with the transaction details
2. Notify your user that the funds have been sent to their bank account
3. Provide the bank reference number for their records (if available)
4. Store the transaction details for future reference and customer support

<Warning>
  If your transaction fails due to sending funds to the wrong address or
  network, recovery may not be possible. Always double-check these details
  before sending.
</Warning>

### Step 8: Link Exchange Order ID with Exchange Transfer ID

After the payout is successful, you must link the exchange transfer ID related to the crypto sent with the exchange order ID:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  PATCH /payout/update-transfer-id
  {
    "exchange_order_id": "92823910232129090",
    "exchange_transfer_id": "9282391023212"
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
      "exchange_order_id": "92823910232129090",
      "exchange_transfer_id": "9282391023212"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Fields:**

- `exchange_order_id`: The order ID from your centralized exchange
- `exchange_transfer_id`: The transfer ID associated with the crypto transaction
