## What Are Payins and Why They Matter

Payins enable your application to seamlessly accept fiat payments from your customers' bank accounts, which will be converted to cryptocurrency. Whether you're a developer or a business owner, this guide will help you integrate DollarPe's Payin system.

<Note>
  **Prerequisites:** 
  - Ensure you have completed the [authentication setup](/guides/authentication/authentication) 
  - Configure your [webhook endpoint](/guides/webhook) for real-time updates 
  - Review the following guides to ensure compatibility: 
    - **[supported geographies](/guides/support/geographies)** 
    - **[supported stablecoins and blockchains](/guides/support/stablecoins_and_blockchains)** 
    - **[supported fiat methods](/guides/support/fiatMethods)** 
  - Verify your users have completed KYC and have at least one verified bank account
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Warning**: Initiate the payin before the quotation expiry time.
</Warning>

## Integration at a Glance

The Payin integration flow for centralized exchanges involves the following key steps:

1. **Validate user requirements** – Ensure the customer has completed KYC verification and has at least one verified bank account added
2. **Fetch exchange rates** – Retrieve the latest cryptocurrency exchange rates
3. **Create a quotation** – Generate a quote for the desired payin amount
4. **Send fiat payment** – Transfer the fiat amount to the provided bank details
5. **Initiate the payin** – Start the payin using the UTR from the fiat payment
6. **Monitor transaction status** – Track the progress of the transaction
7. **Handle completion** – Finalize the payin once the transaction is confirmed

            }
        },
        "required_risk_parameters": [
            "ip_address",
            "device_id",
            "suspicious_activity_report",
            "law_enforcement_agency_report"
        ]
    }
}
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Fields:**

- `supported_fiats`: List of supported fiat currencies
- `supported_assets`: List of supported cryptocurrencies
- `supported_networks`: List of supported blockchain networks
- `coin_limits`: Minimum and maximum limits for each supported cryptocurrency

<Tip>
  If you are storing these configurations in your application to validate user
  inputs and display appropriate options, make sure to update this data
  periodically.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Check Customer KYC and Bank Account status

Before initiating any payin, ensure the customer is KYC-verified and has a verified bank account.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fetch Customer Info">
  ```javascript
  GET /customer/{customer_id}
  Response:
  {
      "status": true,
      "message": "Success",
      "data": {
          "id": "8da49e5e-33d1-48b2-b107-eb34f851b2fd",
          "client_reference_id": "client_id_1",
          "full_name": "John Doe",
          "email": "john@example.com",
          "phone": "+911234123412",
          "country": "IND",
          "type": "INDIVIDUAL",
          "status": "UNVERIFIED",
          "failure_reason": null
      }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fetch Bank Account Info">
  ```javascript
  GET /bank/list/{customer_id}
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
      "count": 1,
      "next": null,
      "previous": "<url>",
      "results": [
        {
          "id": "4e6f1b20-a73c-11ec-b909-0242ac120002",
          "customer_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "account_number": "123456789012",
          "ifsc_code": "ABC123456",
          "vpa": "testing@upi",
          "bank_account_type": "ACCOUNT_DETAILS",
          "bank_account_status": "VERIFIED"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Fetch Exchange Rate

Get the real-time exchange rate for a given crypto asset.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  GET /payin/fetch-rate
  {
    "asset": "usdt",
    "fiat": "inr",
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
      "asset": "USDT",
      "fiat": "INR",
      "rate": 87.2
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Fields:**

- `asset`: Cryptocurrency to be received (e.g., "USDT", "USDC")
- `fiat`: Fiat currency to send (e.g., "INR" for Indian Rupee)
- `rate`: Current exchange rate (amount of fiat per 1 unit of crypto)

<Tip>
  Rates fluctuate constantly based on market conditions. We recommend fetching a
  new rate before each transaction to ensure accuracy.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Create a Quotation

After getting the current rate, create a quotation to lock in the rate.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  POST /payin/quotation
  {
      "asset": "USDC",
      "fiat": "INR",
      "sending_amount": "10000",
      "customer_id": "8da49e5e-33d1-48b2-b107-eb34f851b2fd",

      }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "id": "da43453c-f854-42ac-9a1e-619b37060bbc",

        "expiry_time": "2025-04-17T14:20:27.566842+00:00"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Key Fields:**

<Note>You must complete your transaction before this time expires.</Note>

### Step 5: Send Fiat Payment

Once you have the quotation and bank details, instruct the customer to send the fiat payment:

1. Use the provided bank account details to make the payment
2. Ensure the exact amount is sent as specified in the quotation
3. Keep the UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) from the bank
4. Complete the payment before the quotation expires

### Step 6: Initiate the Payin

After the fiat payment is completed, create a payin request with the UTR:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  POST /payin/initiate
  {
    "quotation_id": "2e104290-07c8-49f1-a5ca-0d27f0078f8a",

    "client_reference_id": "testUser123",
    "utr": "UTR123456789"
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">

  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "id": "9e67356c-cf5e-4fa2-958f-411e7607a307",

        "asset": "USDC",
        "fiat": "INR",
        "payment_method": "BANK_TRANSFER",
        "selfie_url": "https://google.com",
        "sending_amount": 10000.0,
        "dollarpe_rate": 91.91,
        "receiving_amount": 108.8,
        "deposit_instructions": {
            "ifsc": "1234567890",

- `client_reference_id`: Your internal reference ID for tracking (optional)
- `bank_id`: ID of the verified bank account
- `utr`: Unique Transaction Reference from the bank payment
- `status`: Current status of the payin

### Step 7: Monitor Transaction Status

After initiating the payin, you need to track the payin status. There are two ways to monitor this status:

#### Option A: Webhook Integration (Recommended)

Webhooks provide real-time updates about payin status changes. Configure your webhook endpoint to receive these notifications:

```javascript
// Sample webhook payload for payin status updates
{
  "type": "PAYIN",
  "id": "ac7c5360-0b57-4fb7-88f2-df1c371930ee",
  "event": "COMPLETED", // or "FAILED", "PROCESSING"
  "failure_reason": null, // Contains failure reason if status is "FAILED"
  "timestamp": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208137Z",
  "data": {
    "utr": "123456789012", // Bank reference number
    "sending_amount": "858.96000000",
    "fiat": "INR",
    "receiving_amount": "10.00000000",
    "asset": "USDT"
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  If using webhooks, ensure your server acknowledges receipt with a 200 OK
  response to prevent duplicate notifications.
</Tip>

#### Option B: Status Polling

If webhooks aren't feasible, you can periodically check the status using the payin endpoint:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Request">
  ```javascript
  GET /payin/{payin_id}
  ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Response">
  ```json
  {
    "status": true,
    "message": "Success",
    "data": {
        "id": "ac7c5360-0b57-4fb7-88f2-df1c371930ee",
        "quotation_id": "c9f343b5-ff56-4d52-93af-0962f75242b7",
        "customer_id": "8da49e5e-33d1-48b2-b107-eb34f851b2fd",
        "client_reference_id": "payin_first_test",
        "bank_id": "c863b696-7fbd-4b16-b3a7-134aefffb2fe",
        "asset": "USDT",
        "network": "BSC",
        "fiat": "INR",
        "sending_amount": "858.96000000",
        "rate": "87.20000000",
        "receiving_amount": "10.00000000",
        "fees": {
            "client_fee": "",
            "dollarpe_fee": "",
            "pg_fee": "",
            "client_gst": "",
            "dollarpe_gst": "",
            "pg_gst": "",
            "tds": "",
            "gross_exchange_rate": ""
        },
        "utr": "123456789012",
        "status": "PROCESSING",
        "failure_reason": "",
        "created_at": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208137Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-03-21T13:37:53.208142Z"
    }
  }
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  If using the polling approach, we recommend checking no more frequently than
  once every 60 seconds to avoid API rate limits.
</Tip>

**Possible Status Values:**

- `PROCESSING`: Initial state, waiting for payment verification
- `SUCCESS`: Payin has been successfully completed
- `FAILED`: Payin has failed and failure_reason is updated

### Step 8: Handle Transaction Completion

#### Successful Transactions

When a payin is completed successfully:

1. Update your internal records with the transaction details
2. Credit the cryptocurrency to your user's account
3. Notify your user that the funds have been received
4. Store the transaction details for future reference and customer support

### Step 8: Link Exchange Order ID with Exchange Transfer ID

Upon successful payin, ensure the exchange transfer ID (associated with the sent cryptocurrency) is linked to the corresponding exchange order ID.

## Testing Your Integration

### Sandbox Environment

Before going live, test your integration thoroughly in our sandbox environment:

1. Use the base URL: `https://sandbox-api.dollarpe.xyz`
2. Follow the same steps as production
3. Test both successful and failed transaction scenarios

<Tip>
  In the sandbox environment, you can simulate different failure scenarios by
  using specific test values. Refer to our [Sandbox Testing
  Guide](/guides/sandbox-testing) for details.
