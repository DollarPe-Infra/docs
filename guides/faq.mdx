<Accordion title="Integration & Technical Questions">

## How long does integration typically take?

For most partners, the basic integration can be completed within 1-2 weeks. Our support team will work with you to establish a realistic timeline based on your specific needs.

## Do you provide SDKs for integration?

Our SDKs for Python and Node.js are currently under development and will be available soon. These SDKs will simplify the integration process by providing language-specific wrappers for our API endpoints. In the meantime, you can integrate directly with our REST APIs using the documentation provided in our [API Reference](/api-reference-other/overview/introduction) section.

## How do I get API credentials?

Please reach out to our support team at support@dollarpe.com to request API credentials. Our team will guide you through the onboarding process and provide you with the necessary API keys. For production access, you'll need to complete our partner verification process.

## Is a sandbox environment available for testing?

Yes, we provide a comprehensive sandbox environment that mimics our production environment. See our [Sandbox Testing](/guides/sandbox-testing) guide for details.
