</Tabs>

<Warning>
  **Important**: Always start with the **Sandbox** environment for development and testing.  
  Move to **Production** only after thorough testing and validation.
  
  Sandbox and Production environments use different API credentials. Make sure to use the correct credentials for each environment.
</Warning>

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using three custom headers:

<ResponseField name="X-API-KEY" type="string" required>
  Your unique API key provided by DollarPe.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-TIMESTAMP" type="integer" required>
  The current Unix timestamp in seconds.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-SIGNATURE" type="string" required>
  An HMAC SHA256 signature of the request, encoded in Base64.
</ResponseField>

For detailed instructions on generating these headers, see our [Authentication Guide](/guides/authentication).

## Response Format

Our API follows a consistent response format across all endpoints:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Success Response">
    ```json
    {
        "status": true,
        "message": "Success",
        "data": {
            // Response data specific to each endpoint
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bad Request">
    ```json
    {
        "status": false,
        "message": "Bad Request",
        "data": null,
        "errors": {
            "field_name": ["Error message"]
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Internal Server Error">
    ```json
    {
        "status": false,
        "message": "Internal Server Error",
        "data": null,
        "errors": "Unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing Your Integration

Before moving to production, thoroughly validate your integration in our Sandbox environment:

1. Use your Sandbox API credentials and base URLs.
2. Simulate the full customer flow — from user registration to successful transactions.
3. Ensure webhook notifications are received and processed correctly.
4. Implement status polling endpoints as a fallback mechanism in case webhooks fail.
5. Test various error scenarios and implement robust error handling.
