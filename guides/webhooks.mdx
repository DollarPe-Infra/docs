Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications about various events that occur in your integration. When an event happens, we'll send an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL you've configured.

<Note>
To configure your webhook URL please refer to the [Webhook Configuration](/api-reference-other/endpoint/organizations/api-webhooks) guide.

  "event": "string",          // The state change event
  "timestamp": "timestamp",
