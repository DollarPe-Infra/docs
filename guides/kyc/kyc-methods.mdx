## Overview

Know Your Customer (KYC) is a compliance process to verify user identity before they can perform operations like on-ramp and off-ramp transactions. KYC ensures compliance with local and international regulatory standards, enabling secure and trustworthy transactions.

DollarPe provides two KYC methods -

### 1. KYC Sharing
- Businesses performs KYC verification independently and submit the customer's KYC details to DollarPe via [/kyc/add-kyc-data](/api-reference-other/endpoint/kyc/add-kyc-data)
- DollarPe stores the information and also re-performs basic KYC checks ([learn more](/guides/kyc/kyc-sharing))

### 2. KYC SDK
- DollarPe provides a KYC URL and manages the KYC process, including document collection, verification and status updates ([learn mode](/guides/kyc/kyc-sdk))
- Ideal for seamless and quick integration.
